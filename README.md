# Instagram-Filter-Worker

This project is an Instagram image filter. The filter will turn every image uploaded to a blueish color.

This implementation of code includes main.js, which does not includes a web worker. While the main-alt.js implements a web worker to allow the UI to keep running.

By default, index.html will run the main-alt.js version, or the web worker version.
